For people who compile the zips themselves: see https://chdk.kernreaktor.org/chdk-changelog.txt for a textfile containing all the changes.
Note: This file is now autogenerated (by grepping the svn comitt log) on the autobuild server and included in both the complete & normal zips - no need to manually edit it @ devs
Hint: comitt comments that are commented by /* text */ will not be shown in the changelog.txt (maybe for the more technical stuff)
