
= Camera scripting using uBASIC =

The HDK includes a is a slightly modified version of the uBASIC
compiler written by Adam Dunkels, http://www.sics.se/~adam/ubasic/

The camera is now completely scriptable with BASIC programs that
simulate pressing keys

== uBASIC Syntax short manual ==

Keywords: let, if, then, else, for, to, next, goto, gosub, return, end.

Special keywords: click, shoot, sleep.

Variables: lower latin letter from a to z. 16 bit signed integer.

Labels: This version of ubasic doesn't support line numbers.
Instead, labels are used. A label must be the only statement
in a line and start with a colon.

Special keywords syntax:
* click "button_name"
where button_name can be one of: up, down, left, right, set, shoot_half,
shoot_full, zoom_in, zoom_out, menu, display, print, erase.
Corresponding button is "clicked" (pressed and released).

* shoot
Take a picture. Procedure will return when first raw data
will be ready for processing _and_ specified time in menu had
elapsed. Warning: as two "raws" are there when shooting with
long exposures this function is partially broken.

* sleep <number>
Delay for <number> ms. Timer resolution is around 10-30 ms.

Script must be named SCRIPT.BAS and placed in the root directory
on a card.

Default script follows:
=======================
sleep 1000
if a<1 then let a=2
if b<1 then let b=3
for s=1 to a
  shoot
  for n=1 to b
    click "right"
  next n
next s
shoot
for n=1 to a*b
  click "left"
next n
end
========================

Note that values of variables a, b and c are set to values you can
choose from the Alt. Conf. menu.

Maximum script size is 2K. A maximum of 4 nested for loops is allowed.
10 nested gosub calles are possible.

If compile/parse error occurs message with line number is shown
in the upper left corner of a display.

=== using labels and gosub ===

For complex programming tasks, it is often helpful to split
the program into smaller subroutines that can be called
with the gosub command. You can jump to labels using the gosub
statements. A simple program that captures 3 images with increased
ISO settings would look like this:

shoot
for i=1 to 3
  gosub "incISO"
  shoot
next i
for i=1 to 3
  gosub "decISO"
next i
end

:incISO
  click "menu"
  [some more clicks]
  return

:decISO
  click "menu"
  [some more clicks]
  return
