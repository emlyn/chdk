Q. There's no PS.FIR file in the CHDK download for my camera. What do I do?

A. This works for the new camera models, based on DryOS (such as A720IS, A650IS):

   1. Make the SD memory card bootable. Read these instructions how to do it (http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Bootable_SD_card) .
   2. Copy the DISKBOOT.BIN file to the root directory of the SD card.
   3. Write protect the memory card (Lock setting)
