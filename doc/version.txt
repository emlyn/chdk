0.8.6 / #597-604 / PhyrePhoX

* fixed platform_id again :D

+ new function (one of my favourites to date, and i just wrote it :D), only for s-series & TX-1 
you now can use the flash during videos... see http://www.zshare.net/video/52034396605a6fd7/ for example
it is in the override menu at the bottom. you can enable/disable the flash and set the power of the flash (0 - low,1 - middle, 2 - power! this should work in all modes! sorry, no automatic flash power!) 
DryOS (s5is) is experimental, as the propcase values arent verified by "authority"
big thanks to ewavr, Savior of the CHDK-Universe!

* fixed get_platform_id in ubasic and also in the "safety feature"
now returns the right decimal platform id. perhaps someone can figure out why atoi(PLATFORMID) can't be assigned to conf.platformid on cfg creation ( error: initializer element is not constant)?

due to this fix, some cfg items get resetted on cfgs by people who used latest revisions (no biggie i hope):

    conf.raw_cache = 0;
    conf.zoom_override_value = 0;
    conf.fast_ev = 0;
    conf.fast_movie_control = 0;
    conf.fast_movie_quality_control = 0;
    conf.zoom_scale = 100;
    conf.platformid = atoi(PLATFORMID);

this one gave me a headache, and in the end it turned out i was the idiot :D
note: perhaps someone should update the wiki with the decimal platform ids http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/P-ID_(Table) 

+ added two new "raw exception" options: you can now disable the writing of raw/dng automatically when you enable edgeoverlay or set the modedial of the camera to auto (options are OFF at default)
* small fix in connect4

note: somehow all these checks in raw.c and gui_osd.c make me dizzy (self-inflicted, i know), probably should be done in another way (in the future, of course) 

+ added a nice little game - Connect Four (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four )
game was written by CHDKLover & Kettmeister in the german forum, see http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=106 for more links

note: if we hear of reports that the binary is being to big for some cameras since the introduction of Connect 4, we are likely to disable it in the buildconf.inc (so people can compile it using the chdk shell or maybe another build server) 

several fixes in edgeoverlay.c:
- changed file prefix from edge_ to EDG_ which fixes both filelength & saving issues on dryos
- the timestamp of the edge files now is always correct (thx ewavr on hints for both of these)
- the edge overalay now can be moved in alt-mode only. reason: some cameras have functions for up/down/left/right in original firmware, also the overlay was moved when in a menu (before)
- some smaller fixes (i/o & layout) thx to plasmahh 

* update of a few lang files
* moved "show raw saving time" from raw submenu to debug submenu (it isnt really a feature)
trying to split my modifications into smaller svn commits now 

0.8.5 / #596 / ewavr
* fixed colors in DNG thumbnail for some cameras 

0.8.4 / #596 / ewavr
* sx100is - improver power-on procedure
+ sx100is - added jogdial support in menu, file browser and text reader

0.8.4 / #594 / reyalp
+ raw operations for lua scripts, see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2646.0.html
 set_raw_develop("filename") -- develop raw on next shot. If filename is nil (or omitted), any pending raw develop is canceled.
 raw_merge_start(operation) -- operation is a number: 0=sum 1=average. Other=error.
 raw_merge_add("filename") -- merge a file.
 raw_merge_end() -- complete merge operation.

0.8.3 / #593 / PhyrePhoX

* updated french.lng
+ added "saving time switch" in raw menu (better in debug menu?) - it is disabled at default (when enabled, shows time it takes to save raw/dng)
+ added a feature that allows using cfgs from a different camera by resetting "critical" settings on startup of the platform id doesnt match (more settings? less settings? need input)
+ added "get_platform_id" to ubasic, which returns platformid (integer), with the help of this you can code platform depending scripts (in lua we dont need this, as we can get strings there)

0.8.2 / #592 / PhyrePhoX

* fixed a590 zoom table (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2659.msg24733.html#msg24733)
* language updates
* fixed very small bug in gui_lang.c which caused a bug in the dng menu
+ added turkish language
+ added define CAM_BRACKETING for cameras that have bracketing in original firmware (g7,g9,s2is,s3is,s5is - need propcase for the dryos ones!) for gui.c
* RAW osd elements now change to DNG when dng saving is enabled
 
0.8.2 / #590-591 / ewavr

+ added initial DNG support (yay!)
+ added rear curtain flash sync for a570 & sx100is 
* small language fix: "raw develop" the same in main and popup menu 

0.8.1 / #587-587 / reyalp

some ignore props 
Set CFLAGS differently for gcc3 and gcc4. See http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2500.30.html 
check in correct stubs_entry.S  (sd1100)

0.8.1 / #585-586 / PhyrePhoX

+ added g9 chdk for 1.00d (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2342.msg24602.html#msg24602)
* updated spanish.lng 
* small edit in notes.txt of a590 

0.8.1 / #584 / PhyrePhoX

+ initial import of a590 port - thanks to ma_jk (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2361.msg24541.html#msg24541 and the whole thread)


0.8.0 / #581-583 / php

* small fixes, updates

0.8.0 / #580 / PhyrePhoX

tadaa! major pimping of an already cool feature!
you can now SAVE and LOAD edge overlays! this was written by PlasmaHH (shy guy, only in irc :D)
Yes, you read it right:
- save an edge overlay: create an overlay (enable overlay and press half-press) -> go to overlay menu and press save
- load an overlay (go to menu and choose an *.edg file)
- create overlays from jpgs in playmode! (only works on cameras that have a "hardware" switch of play/recmode for now, because on for example s3is halfpressing the shutter activates rec mode!
- free memory by using the item in the edge menu (also you should disable edge-overlay)
changes / enhancements to the mod by me: 
- together with the edge overlay the zoom setting is saved, so when you load the file after one year it zooms to the position your camera had when you shot it!
- added the option so that an edge overlay is "locked", meaning the edgeoverlay you loaded or just created is not overwritten in the osd at half-press (this checkbox is overwritten on each camera startup... no big deal, but i dont like it like that right now)
This is a really great feature (for example for LONG-TERM TIMELAPSES, or stop-motion movies, or vertigo-effect, or stereography... the list is endless :D)

* restructured the root menu (put imo the most often used items to the top, moved edge overlay from OSD menu to the root menu, moved remote params menu to the misc menu)

because of this new feature and all the new cams i upped the version to 0.8.0 already...
P.S: had to rewrite some of PlasmaHHs stuff (e.g. write -> fwrite), i hope i did everything correctly (it's working flawlessly on s3is and a620)

0.7.7 / #578-579 / php

* small fixes

0.7.7 / #577 / php

* enabled sd1100/ixus80 build again
about the video_control: perhaps it is worth digging out this old thread to check for ewavrs "2nd" way: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,952.msg18413.html#msg18413 
i just uncommented this function from cameras that are KNOWN to crash using it. we need more reports.
also: this is a dirty workaround, it just wont show the fast movie control item in the menu of the reported cams. actually it should also be uncommented from the ubasic and lua function.
(added this quickfix because of this bugreport: http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=90)

0.7.7 / #576 / PhyrePhoX

+ added preliminary support for the g9 100g (and 100f) - see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2342.msg24443.html#msg24443
comment: needs the other firmwares as well
todo: fix the ixus80 / compiler isse, add a590, up the version to 0.7.9 - fix more bugs, release 0.8.0 RC, get things tested and fixed - make release party for 0.8.0!


0.7.6 / #574-575 / php & reyalp

* verious fixes

0.7.6 / #573 / phyrephox

+ added french.lng

0.7.6 / #570-572 / reyalp

*various small fixes

0.7.6 / #565-569 / reyalp
+ merge ixus80_sd1100 from chr
  see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,650.msg24281.html#msg24281
+ Added encoded diskboot support to makefiles
* Set -march=armv5te for GCC3
* ixus80_sd1100 1.00c is now sig_ref_dryos_2
* sig_ref_*.txt now must have start address on first line
 
0.7.5 / #564 / php

*ixus75 - added adresses for ev compensation (thx fudgey) and corrected raw size in camera.h (thx hacki)
also changed version number to reflect latest changes...

0.7.4 / #562-563 / reyalp && phyrephox

* fixed bug in ixus75 builds... actually it was rather easy - the automatic memisostuff was missing before... thx hacki 
ixus75: get play/record state from playrec_mode like s3is
use makefile_sub.inc 

0.7.4 / #560-561 / reyalp

ixus75_sd750: find zoom_status, enable CAM_CAN_UNLOCK_OPTICAL_ZOOM_IN_VIDEO, use generic/capt_seq.c, set svn:eol-style
lua examples: clean up indentation 
add fix from http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2042.msg21063.html#msg21063 for ixus40 100k
make shooting_expo_param_override safe to call from asm
turn off CAM_CONSOLE_LOG_ENABLED for ixus75
lua example formatting 

0.7.4 / #558-559 / PhyrePhoX

* now the ixus75 build should be properly created, however there are a few things missing:
* entertocompensationevf & exitfromcompensationevf adresses
* zoom_status (and probably more you need for CAM_CAN_UNLOCK_OPTICAL_ZOOM_IN_VIDEO - ewavr?)
the whole defines block in camera.h looks a bit fishy to me, i barely touched it though
* fixed error in makefile (my bad). 

let's see if this compiles on the autobuild and people complain... 

0.7.4 / #557 / PhyrePhoX

+ added preliminary support for ixus75_sd750 for 100b 101a and 102a (101a also works for 101b, cp in makefile) - port done by TPC (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,898.15.html) 
this does NOT compile yet (thus it is disabled in batch-zip & batch-zip-complete to avoid autobuild fuckup)
needs a few things: see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,898.msg23979.html#msg23979 for details

0.7.4 / #556 / PhyrePhoX

*fixed a bug that prevented curves from showing up in latest builds regardless of OPT_CURVES state... i wonder why only one person noticed it so far :D

0.7.4 / #555 / reyalp
+ add os.listdir to lua oslib, updated llibtst.lua
  syntax t=os.listdir("name",[showall])
  returns array of filenames, or nil, strerror, errno
  if showall is true, t includes ".", ".." and deleted entries
  NOTE except for the root directory, names ending in / will not work

0.7.3 / #554 / PhyrePhoX

+ added a few LUA example scripts for people to learn from, plus they might be quite useful to some

countdown.lua = simple countdown script which plays a sound when finished (written by kettmeister)
lotto.lua = random number generator, generates a set (you can decide how many) of numbers (you can decide the range), including the options to sort the output and to have "exclusive" numbers, meaning a given number is generated only once per execution (written by PhyrePhoX and Msl)
metronome.lua = a script for the musicians among us - plays sound and uses the print_led (written by Kettmeister)
stopwatch.lua = a stopwatch, can be used to stop laptime or split time (you will figure it out :D) (written by kettmeister)

all scripts working and commented. Thanks to the participants. Lua really isnt as easy as ubasic, with these examples however you can get a nice overview.
next task is to include not only example scripts, but actual working scripts that even are photography related, i.e. timelapse & the like.

0.7.3 / #553 / PhyrePhoX

maintenance, bugfixing
* spanish.lng
* buildconf (for whim)
* fixed a bug in the new "raw suffix feature" (see http://www.wirklemms.de/chdk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5411#5411 )

0.7.2 / #552 / PhyrePhoX

maintenance: moved the optional stuff to the new buildconf.inc, for easier parsing and/or modifying (whim - maybe in your CHDK shell?) - see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2509.msg23423.html#msg23423
now when you "undef" the stuff, the files will not be compiled/linked anymore (as they did with my previous committ, thus you didnt "save" as much binary space as projected)

0.7.2 / #551 / PhyrePhoX

* updated spanish lang file - http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=84
* added & updated fonts - http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=85 (note: there are a lot of fonts now, maybe we need to discuss and vote if need them all, also licenses need to be checked)
* small bugfix, "Show Screne luminance" Does not get computed when enabled alone, see http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=82
* changed menu structure (moved debug menu to misc menu, switched some entries in the main menu - now imo most used features are on the top, comments welcome!)
+ added feature: in bracketing mode you now have the option to add a suffix to the raw filename, so that later you can easily identifiy the raws that were created during bracketing. it is disabled at default, and can be enabled in the bracketing submenu (or should it be moved to the raw submenu?). idea & patch by rr807 in the german forum, see http://www.wirklemms.de/chdk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4482#4482 & http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=86. btw if you enable this, it is likely that your raw files cant be seen by the PC anymore when you connect your cam via usb cable to it, so use your cardreader (also note that dng4-ps will not find the corresponding jpgs!)
+ added compiler info to buildinfo (changed all lang files accordingly). shows the compiler version - found in PlasmaHHs diff @ http://plasmahh.projectiwear.org/chdk.html (rest will follow soon, need PlasmaHHs help though)
+ added option to show temperature in fahrenheit (up to now it was coupled with time format) http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=34

0.7.1 / #549-550 / reyalp

* made raw hook stuff generic http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=80
Also protect preserve regs for raw hook calls on all cams.
fix some EOLs and eol-style props. 
* moved .ltorg up a bit for gcc4 (works fine with gcc3 too) See http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2500.0.html 

0.7.1 / #548 / php

+ added ukrainian.lng - http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2514.msg23414.html#msg23414 

0.7.1 / #547 / EWAVR

+ G7: added jogdial support in menu, file browser and text reader
* G7, A650: fixed "sporadic RAW images" bug
* increased maximum 'badpixel' file size
* fixed ND filter control for IXUS960 (maybe) 

0.7.0 / #546 / PhP

* enabled default param save in scripts again, as it *might* have been fixed by reyalp by his previous checkins
* changed spanish lang file
* aligned memory info better in german & english lang file
* moved "make bootable" from debug menu to misc menu, as imo it makes more sense there
* also moved "swap partition" from debug menu to misc (left CREATE partiton in debug though)
* also moved "reset options" from main menu to misc menu
* fixed motion detection bug in the s5is : http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=70 however i dont know if it was a firmware version dependent issue. now motiondetection has lost the "super fast" behaviour if i'm not mistaken. workaround?
+ added 2 example scripts by msl: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2497.0.html & http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2496.0.html - great job!
* added #defs for a few things in camera.h. probably not the right place, can be moved somewhere else i guess
    #define ZOOM_OVERRIDE               0   // Shall zoom-override be used? default 0 becoz not implemented right now
    #define UBASIC                      1   // Shall ubasic be compiled into build?
    #define LUA                         1   // Shall lua support be compiled into build?
    #define BOOTLOGO                    2   // 0 = no bootdelay at all,1 = version info, 2 = image + version info, if set to 1 or 2, one can still disable it in the menu
hint: these #defs maybe can be used by the chdk shell?
talk: i guess undeffing some stuff is not enough, as for example curves.c still gets compiled. is this an issue?


talk: originally i wanted to add a new submenu to misc "advanced menus", in this submenu you could enable/disable the curves menu, debug menu & remote parameters menu (simplifies the menu, most people dont use these, so it should be defaulted to OFF) - BUT i failed in dynamically changing the menu, maybe someone else has an idea how to implement http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=41

0.6.5 / #542-545 / reyalp

* add get_mode to lua. Returns 3 values: bool record, bool video, number mode

* add islower (will need for lua strlib)
* fix memory info lang item 
* fix http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=74 by using Fut API for require 
* possible fixes for http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=25 and http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,265.msg21396.html#msg21396 

0.6.5 / #541 / reyalp

+ added os.stat and os.utime (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2267.msg23046.html#msg23046 )
* make utime return values on dryos follow standard
* add SetFileTimestamp to sig_ref_dryos
* added CHDK/LUALIB and CHDK/SCRIPTS/TEST to zip

0.6.3 / #537 / PhP

+ added hungarian lang file (thx titan_g9)

0.6.1 / #533 / reyalp

zoom override is temporarily disabled 

0.6.1 / #532 / PhP

* fixed bug regarding zoom override feature (added check, see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2426.0.html)

0.6.0 / #531 / PhyrePhoX

* increased version number to reflect for latest changes from previous revisions
+ added zoom override. first installment allows you to set a specific zoom value (on s3is for example between 0 and 128, on a620 between 0 and 8) that will be set upon starting the cam in record mode. Extra Photo Operations -> Zoom Override. You can disable and enable it there (default: off), also you can set the startup behaviour (there isnt much working right now :D). In the future: Not only set the zoom steps (in accurate int) but maybe set it using mm & factor (much like the shutter override menu stuff to allow for easing setting using "mnemonics"). Also will implement ZOOM BRACKETING. could be done via script, but then again everything could be done via script ;) Also i am wondering if i should focus after zooming. Also the zoom override should work like this, that no matter what value of zoom you set using the zoom lever, before each pic is taken the zoom will be set to the value you specified in the menu (much like shutter & aperture override). Also maybe implement the feature so that it remembers the actual zoom value you set (via lever/button) before shutting off the cam - and restore it when you power it on again!?
This feature works a) as somehow a "C" (custom mode in which you can save a few settings that will be remembered even when you shut off the cam) mode for cameras that dont have it and b) for studio photogs or other situations where you need the zoom in a fixed value over a long period of time. Noticed a bug: when you use this feature to zet zoom upon startup, you cant zoom out using the zoomlever, unless you zoom out before - i guess it is because the camera thinks you are still in wide (zoom 0). i guess one can fix that, dunno how though (yet).
* added security - now most "dangerous" functions (can also be called via ubasic or lua) are executed in record mode only (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2335.0.html & http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=30)
* added srpenneys documentation from http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=24
* fixed eol style in readme & version files so that the autobuilds will have readmes that can be read on windoze without problems
* fixed bug that was responsible for disabled OSD (see http://chdk.kernreaktor.org/mantis/view.php?id=31) - workaround up to now was to disable splashscreen. i fixed it by uncommenting my own code that disabled the OSD while the splashscreen is shown. this means that from this revision the CHDK osd icons/items will be shown on startup at the same time as the bootlogo - this is ugly, but not a critical bug, plus i guess it will be fixed sooner or later!
+ added czech language file
* fixed russian lang file - pethead updated it in the wiki (there are a lot of outdated lang files in the wiki, come on people!)

+ changed makefiles: when you compile, the memisosize is written to caminfo.txt, along with the "maximum" size that is defined in makefile.inc for that specific camera. in batch-zip and batch-zip-complete this file file is "catted" into the logfile and then deleted. this will make searching for cameras whose bins are "out of range" much easier. Thanks to whim who basically wrote the whole code!
	Note: this is a first implementation, and prone to errors, as both whim and i are no makefile pros - if you have comments, dont hesitate to let us know!

0.5.0 / PP

+ added dutch language file
+ added ubasic command: get_time. can be fed with 0 (returns seconds), 1 (minute), 2 (hour),3 (day) 4 (month) 5 (year) - command also exists in lua, though must be fed with CHARS
+ added ubasic command: get_mode - returns 0 in record mode, 1 in playback mode, it's that simple. useful for shutting of scripts that are meant to be run in a certain mode (like 99% of all available scripts).  - someone needs to port that to lua, as i javent played around with that yet!
+ added ubasic commands: get_quality, get_resolution (return quality and resolution regardless of OS) & set_quality,set_resolution - for possible values see http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/PropertyCase (basically for quality you can 0-2, 2 being the worst, resolution can be set between 0 and 8, see the wiki) - needs porting to lua as well.
* changed 2 default settings in the conf: now "Hide OSD in playback" is enabled at default, also "disable saving raw while recording video" is enabled at default(S-eries)
* fixed some newline related warnings at compile time

Author's comment: Now everything should be at hand to be able to create true universal scripts. i'm thinking for example of fudgeys motion detection one, should run on digic II and III now, also on cams with and without moviebutton - all the commands are there. who is willing to write such a script? also please add the get_mode check in the beginning.


0.4.3 / PP

* changed Grid readme (thx to anonymous wiki editor)
+ added syscurves.scv to zipfile again (funny i didnt notice that it was missing before!)
* changed makefile - "copy duplicate" firmware stuff moved to the bottom (is cleaner now, also i hope this "unbreaks" chdk shell by whim)
* reverted zebra patch from 486 / 0.3.6 for the time being until we figure out another way to use Zebra AND the canon OSD (without flickering) - see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1849.msg20777.html#msg20777 (there might be a patch that is working, however i cannot test it right now)
* added comment in russian.lng files (they are NOT compatible to juciphox!)

* merged ewavrs latest patch from trunk (regarding sx100 multipartion)
* fixed a bug in script.c - now param z should be shown in the param list (see http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1865.msg20624.html#msg20624) - thx 2 fudgey
* enabled file reader "wrap by words" as default in the cgf
* set the readme as "last read file" in the filereader
* updated german lng file (thx to msl & gehtnix)
+ added ubasic command: get_video_button - returns 1 if dedicated video record button is present (like on s-series or tx-1). One more step on the road of universal scripts.

+ added sx100 100b - http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,237.msg19899.html#msg19899

* language update in trunk (finnish)
* makefile: small zips now include readme and version history

0.3.4 / PP

* small modifications in notes.txt of each platform: added can do's and not can do's (by no means complete, just a start to get into the right direction) so in each individual readme you now get to see camera specific notes (for example when video overrides are not working for a special platform yet)

0.3.3 / PP

* makefile changes: instead of _complete, the big zips now have a -full suffix, also _bins got removed and replaced by NULL.

0.3.2 / PP

+ raw subtract for filebrowser by reyalp - http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2099.msg19362.html#msg19362
* makefile changes: 
		added several docs in the /docs dir, these are "catted" together during compilation -> one big readme file's gonna be put into the zip. Also includes camera specific notes, if existing (placeholders for now) (thx for helping with this, Hacki).
* Ixus 860is / SD870 - fixed ubasic_set_led (diff provided by FE50)
* patched symboldmod and changed splashscreen a little (diff sent in by CHDKLover)
* added toggle in scripts menu: now the saving of script params can be turned on/off (default: off)


474 / 0.2.7
Jucifer

- applied reyalp's patches: a540-modes-2 and lua-warnings-1
- added a few more checks for synchable remote related stuff
- fixed finnish.lng a bit (Mikko70)



473 - 0.2.6 - PP
* updated langfiles
+ added option in misc - startsound. if enabled (disable as default) you will hear a short beep right before the splash screen. will someday be the antitheft function (yet to be coded...)
* small fix in OSD element fast_ev, should be better now, but still not perfect
+ added functions EnterToCompensationEVF() & ExitFromCompensationEVF(); -> read about it here http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2051.msg19300.html#msg19300
    --> prepared the sources so that adding the adresses to other cams will be easy - needs ASM people though
* small patch in symbol mod by CHDKLover
* fixed bug in makefile
+ batch-zip-complete: filename of the zip now gets an "_complete" appended

oh, and thanks Hacki for letting me steal endless hours of your sleep ;)

- Lua/md_detect_motion(): optionalized the rest of parameters (some default values are the same as in fudgey's MD scripts)



471 / 0.2.5
Jucifer

- tried to make get_usb_power behave similarly on as many cams as possible, hopefully I didn't break anything
- modified Lua/get_usb_power(): behaves as get_usb_power(int edge)
- optionalized parameters in Lua/md_detect_motion() as described in documentation (well, only the first 6 params are mandatory)
- messed around with the language files a bit



470 / 0.2.4
Jucifer

- added auj's motion detection/Lua patch: now returns the number of detected cells
+ added whoever's scriptless remote code (http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2041.msg18833.html#msg18833)
- changed the remote submenu a bit



467 / 0.2.31
PhyrePhoX

* cleaned out a little bit, deleted & moved some stuff (now grids, fonts & all lang files are zipped into the big zip)
* changed a few conf values 
+ added Fahrenheit conversion of the temperature. Kicks in when you enable the 12h clock format, there is NO extra menu item



468 / 0.2.3
Jucifer

- added reyalp's scripting commands "peek" (read the contents of a memory address) and bitwise operations (bitand, bitor, bitxor, bitshl, bitshri, bitshru, bitnot) to Lua

464 / 0.2.1
PhyrePhoX

+ added syscurves.cfv
+ added eggtimer example script thx to gehtnix from german forum
+ in osd menu you can now set new option: Hide on Display. Means: When you press the display button to cycle through the original canon display states (symbols on, symbols off, evf, display off), CHDK symbols are now hidden when canon symbols are hidden as well (this does not work in EVF, as the propertycase does not update).
+ visual feedback during fast_video_quality changes - now when you enable fast_video_quality_control, you can see in OSD the quality/bitrate that you change via up/down


*makefile.inc (added ixus960)
* updated/added finnish, english, german langfiles* changed default conf values again: shootdelay (from 11 to 0), remote_enable from 1 to 0, renamed hide_osd_in_playback
* small cosmetic change: splash screen color now is red, to distinguish our beta build from the trunk. this is likely to get changed someday anyhow. adds a little spice though ;)
* fixed a bug in CHDKLovers select/case statement, got a diff from him (thanks!)

as always, code is ugly but should work. 



463 / 0.2.0
Jucifer

- changed version numbering

- updated some remote-related stuff from SDM

+ added ixus960_sd950-100d support from SDM



461 / 0.10
PhyrePhoX

+ new OSD Element - Temperature
		- Enabled by default (optical temperature)
		- set in OSD Menu to either show optical, ccd, battery or ALL temps at once
		- position can edited in OSD Layout editor
		- thread about temperature: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2021.0.html
+ video quality control added. when enabled (in video overrides), by the use of the up/down button you can increase or decrease movie quality OR bitrate (depends on what you enabled in the video override menu) - WHILE you are recording!
* changed Fast video control so that it isnt enabled at default, only works on a few cameras (pause and unpause movie by pressing left/right while recording) - needs further development
* when using fast video control switch and the pause function now the remaining time calculation is reset, so it reflects the change in bitrate faster
* changed a few default conf values (symbols now enabled at default, because symbol file now is served together with binary)
+ introduced new versioning system: 0.10 now, X.10 will be major release (and probably without bugs, with proper documentation, scripts, optimized etc), 0.X0 will be something like "new features, a bit ironing out etc", 0.1X will be just bugfixes and really small changes
+ added vers.req to svn, will be included in zipfile when autobuilded, will definitly be useful...
+ wrote two sample readmes, one for dryos, one for vxworks, they are included in the batch-zip-complete archives, in respect to OS version. these are just drafts, need input from you. yeah you heard me, from YOU!
+ added version.txt that will also be included in said archive, reflecting latest changes. it is not cleaned up as of now, probably never will be, but gives a rough overview over latest development
+ added ubasic statement case/select switch by CHDKLover from here: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1995.0.html as of now i chose the "safe" method, the multi statement, due to people not reacting. hopefully they test it in this build so we can decide on one option!
* renamed get_movie_state to get_movie_status in ubasic
+ added command get_temperature (example: "get_temperature 0", 0 returns optical, 1 returns CCD and 2 returns battery temp)
+ added a few grids from the wiki
+ changed makefile bigtime: now with new command batch-zip-complete you now have an environment to compile a complete CHDK archive for each cam including binaries, readmes (according to OS), scripts, version history and so on. it is planned that the archive will be crammed with useful information (readmes, howtos - into the books folder), grids, scripts (working ones, universal ones, and also code fragments that will serve as examples), curves, symbols, fonts (copyright!?) and so on. as of now i just added a few of these, and some dummy texts so that zip file will accept the folders. again i need YOU to help on developing a good structure and good scripts, readmes and so on. with this build, people no longer need to sift through the wiki or the forum to find all the good stuff. at least i do hope so.
* changed random command, now you can supply two values min & max.
		example: "playsound random 3 6" will play the sounds 3,4,5,6 in random order (if repeated in a while loop) 
+ added ewavrs sx100 patch from here: http://tools.assembla.com/chdk/changeset/460 (adjustable alt button)
+ added new command playsound. can and should be used from ubasic, via "playsound 0", where 0 is the startup sound. there are sounds ranging from 0 to 7, 7 being a nasty long beep. the first few sounds can only be played if they are NOT muted by the camera, the other beeps will be played though (cam must be unmuted though, didnt test it with the nasty error beep though i gotta admit). this feature will lead to many more features, for example anti theft protection together with DGs Disco lights ;)
		0 = startup sound, 1 = shutter sound, 2 = button press sound, 3 = selftimer, 4 = short beep, 5 = af confirmation, 6 = error beep, 7 = long beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep (nasty!)
* adjusted makefile.inc so that all cameras are in it now (defaulted to my s3is by the way, not that it should matter)

* adjusted memisosize on ixus860. soon gonna adjust the size of all cams, we're getting low on space ;)
* adjusted videotables on ixus860 (see patch from ewavr http://tools.assembla.com/chdk/changeset/455
+ added whoever's fix for ixus950's touchwheel behaviour from here: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,2024.0.html

* lng files (german & english), also copied to new folder CHDK\LANG (for gmake batch-zip-complete)



thanks to Ewavr, Hacki, reyalp, ljl, jucifer and all the guys hanging out in the irc chan ;)

ps: i hope i didnt forget anything or anyone.

* renamed CHDK.CFG to CCHDK.CFG ("collaborative CHDK") to end conflicts when you switch from branch to trunk or vice versa.
* fixed bug in "fast switch" for movie recording, now you can decrease bitrate smoothly
* when bitrate is changed, calculation process is restarted so you can see the changes in bitrate way better now (bug: display has to be redrawn somehow, also the workaround via the global var movie_reset isnt really beautiful, my whole code isnt beautiful, to be exact :D)
* changed symbols
* updated german.lng


thx to the users in the german chdk forum (msl, gehtnix) for bugreporting, testing

also this is a test if tortoise svn still fails on me when committing.

* added video_overrides, SDHC & touchwheel "patch" from mil22 from here: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1962.msg18265.html#msg18265
 -> needs a bit ironing out (supposedly bitrate setting is fubared)
+ added fast movie switches:
it is now possible to quickly change video quality during recording via the up/down buttons
also you can pause a movie by pressing left, unpause it by pressing right
for this feature a new option has been added to the video override menu.

drawbacks: there is no visual feedback yet on quality change/pause/unpause functions
+ new ubasic command: set_movie_status. If you set it to 1, movie will be paused. 2 will unpause movie and 3 will stop movie. 

needs proper testing, proper visual representation

thanks to Hacki & ewavr

+ added cyril42e's script restoring (script jumps to label "restore" on interrupt) and alt-button fix, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1687.msg15345.html#msg15345

- updated some alt-menu stuff to be the same as in trunk

(- ixus50 without scriptless remote support for now)

(pretty much from http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,688.0.html:)

- all uBASIC commands beginning with "get_" can now use the "new" syntax (e.g. [f=]get_focus, S=get_prop 205), the ones listed in Wikia work as they used to

+ applied PhyrePhox's customizations (the newest commands have the new syntax ([x=]command)), http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,978.msg8339.html#msg8339 

+ applied wontolla's RAW purge, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,557.msg5849.html#msg5849

+ applied m2tk's gui_fselect.c-patch, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1059.msg9530.html#msg9530

+ applied CHDKLover's and msl's Symbol Mod, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1133.msg10043.html#msg10043

- applied toinech's custom JPG processing (and added a reminder in state-display), http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,932.msg10359.html#msg10359

+ applied Velo's Lua Scripting Integration (and added all new uBASIC-commands), http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1194.msg11413.html#msg11413

+ added scripting command get_exp_count (value incremented by 1 on every exposure, returns numbers as in the files saved by the camera (1-9999, should be taken into account when scripting, maybe something along these lines:
T=get_exp_count+N
if T>9999 then T=T-9999
press "shoot_half"
press "shoot_full"
do
until get_exp_count=T
release "shoot_full"
), ubasic syntax: [x=]get_exp_count ([]=optional))

+ added scripting command is_pressed. Usage is similar to is_key, but checks, if a button is pressed, when the command is called. This can be really useful in autostart-scripts.

+ added script command autostarted, returns 1/true if script was autostarted, 0/false if not

- modified get_script_autostart and set_script_autostart to read & write conf.script_startup (values: 0=off, 1=on, 2=once)

- new script autostart option(s): Off, On, Once

- user menu modified
  - now with 14 entries (that's what fits on my screen with the default font)
  - main menu -entry removed
  - invoked also with shoot_half + menu
  - can be used as root menu, main menu becomes accessible with shoot_half + menu

- faster menu navigation
  - in alt menus and file browser, shoot_half can be used with up/down to move 4 items up/down at a time
  - int-variable changing behaviour is modified: zoom rocker works also a bit like shift: when "held down" while pressing left/right, zoom_out changes values by 10, zoom_in by 100, shoot_half by 1000.
  - int-variables can be set to 0 with shoot_half+set
  - when changing enum-type-variables (e.g. Tv bracketing value), zoom_in(+left/right) changes value by 6 (2EV), zoom_out and(/or) shoot_half by 3 (1EV).

+ added numbers 2, 4 and 5 from cyril42e's modification list, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1687.msg15345.html#msg15345

+ added scriptless Ricoh & home hacked remote support from SDM 1.70

+ added fbonomi's shot histogram, commands shot_histo_enable 0|1, get_histo_range from to, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1145.msg13008.html#msg13008

+ added hiker_jon's edge overlay code for testing, may or may not work, http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,1192.msg11317.html#msg11317

+ and last and perhaps least, added the missing get_raw_nr to tokenizer.c

I may have forgotten something. Hopefully nothing major, though.

Branch time.
This branch will be the playground of Jucifer and me (PhyrePhoX) - although others can join in on the fun :)
We are trying to deliver actual working features, bug fixes and enhancements, most of them already being tested and accepted amongst a wide "audience".

For more information see here: http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,688.0.html

Lot of these new features can and will be merged with the official trunk.
