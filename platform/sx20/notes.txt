Development notes:
note from camera.h:
// the SX20 has a very small amount of free ram once CHDK is loaded - probably due to the large display buffers in use
// The RAM is so low that edge detection and zebra crash the device
// unloading the games from this build free's 14k of ram allowing zebra and edge to
// work normally and the random crashes to go away
