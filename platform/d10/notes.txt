Power shot D10
Camera information

Digic IV
propset 2
No iris, only ND filter

This is a semi-functional ALPHA build

Not implemented/Not Working
- movie_rec: meaning all movie related functions
- zebra
- dark frame subtraction control. Don't try to use this, it will break horribly.
- USB remote support

Working/completed
- loader/* done
- spytask: gui, menus etc
- kbd task: key input, script execution, write lock override
- initial work for all stubs_entry and stubs_min done, but there are probably some mistakes.
- most files in platform other than capt_seq and movie_rec, including mode map, fl_tbl etc.
- Tv bracketing in continuous mode
- histogram
- multi partition support
- motion detection
- setting Tv from script
- DNG matrix (DavidB)
- OSD size/aspect (DavidB,reyalP)

Scripts tested successfully
- llibtst.lua 
- setmode.lua batch mode, including play/rec change
- tstcallf.lua
- romlog.lua
- badpixel.lua
- mdfb digic 3

Known issues:
- Continuous shooting with raw/dng enabled crashes (sometimes ?)
- CHDK OSD disappears frequently.
- If you press the shutter quickly without waiting for focus, override settings are ignored
- DNG has dark borders. This is intentional, the active area covers all pixels that have any data, but there are large areas which have data but are distinct from the normal jpeg area.
