****************************************

Camera depending notes:

- S90 uses (as the G11) Propset 3 of properties
- S90 uses new color palette (as G11) 
- dryos with changed behaviour to previous dryos versions (stat() funtion, max. path lenght, etc.)
- For cameras with firmware 101b, use the 101c port.
- Blocking of Jogdial events does not work exactly as on the G11. The Jogdial events get somehow queued
  and are passed to the oem firmware after leaving the ALT mode. Needs to be debuged
  and fixed. ;)
