General info:
==============
Digic IV, dryos, propset 2 (there may be digic IV specific stuff, but nothing found so far)
10mp sensor, 12 bits/pixel
Video is h264 NOT mjpeg
Real iris, no ND filter
Multi partition support

Booting:
=========
Both manual & automated loading are supported
With diskboot camera will always boot in play mode; press halfshoot to switch to record,
 or hold the power button for ~1s to power on in record mode.
With FI2, you must boot in play mode in order to access the firm update menu.

Buttons:
=========
Direct print button is the ALT button. This can be assigned a function in the
 original canon firmware. Hold it down to access the canon firmware function
The DISP key don't switch off the display; in the Canon menu the sleep functin can be
 registered to the print button.
The ALT button can be set to FLASH from the CHDK menu for better handling.
Other keys use the standard mapping for cameras with an erase button.

Notes:
=======
ISO3200 mode:
 Uses only a part of the RAW buffer, RAW files are not usable in this mode.
 Gives very fast (up to ~ 5 fps) frame rate, but with reduced image size (1600x1200,
 interpolated) and much noise (high ISO)
Force flash:
 Works fine, also with ISO3200 mode, up to 3-4 fps with lowest flash level are possible
Long filenames:
 As all of the DryOS based cameras, the SX10 uses short filenames (8.3 "DOS" style), using
 long filenames may not work in some conditions, e.g. with the bracketing prefix setting or
 from scripts.
